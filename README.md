## Introduction
Falihax is a fictional bank created as part of a hackathon run by [CyberSoc](https://cybersoc.org.uk/), 
which was designed to include security vulnerabilities that needed to be fixed. This is a Flask application 
in Python, which allows users to open a bank account, make bank transfers and view transactions from 
bank accounts. The task was to find and fix as many security vulnerabilities as possible. 

The premise for this hackathon from CyberSoc was:
> Falihax is a brand new, 100%* real and secure banking company. Last year, they
contracted a group of computer science students to build a website for them -
unfortunately, none of these students
were [CyberSoc](https://cybersoc.org.uk/?r=falihax) members and so didn't know
how to build a web app securely.
> Recently, they have experienced a number of
attacks on their website. They are insistent that their website is very safe and
not at all vulnerable, but nevertheless they have asked you to help them improve
their security!
> **percentage expressed in binary. 4% margin of error.*

## Getting Started

### Requirements
To use this application, you will need:
- Python 3.10

If using the Postgresql database provided, you will also need:
- Docker
- Docker-compose

### Creating environment file
Before attempting to run the server, you will need to create a file with the filename `.env` with the following contents:
```.env
# Keys
SECRET_FLASK_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_FLASK_KEY"
SECRET_CAPTCHA_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_CAPTCHA_KEY"
```
Replace `YOUR_SECRET_FLASK_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_CAPTCHA_KEY` with long random keys that contain 
a mixture of upper and lowercase letter, numbers and special characters.

### Running Postgresql (optional but recommended)
If the Postgresql database is not used, the Flask application will default to using a sqlite database.

To use Postgresql, using the docker compose file provided, add the following to your `.env` file:
```.env
# Database settings
DB_POSTGRESQL=True
DB_USER="YOUR_USERNAME"
DB_PASS="YOUR_PASSWORD"
```
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with a secure username/password combination
for the Postgresql database.

Before running the Flask application, run the following command to create/start the database:
```
docker-compose up
```

When finished with the database, run the following command to close the database:
```
docker-compose down
```

### Running the Flask application
Install the required Python libraries using the terminal command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the Flask server, type in the terminal:
```
python app.py
```
In your web browser, navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web application.

### Creating an admin account
An admin account will be able to set the credit score of users within the application. 
You will need to have already created an account within the application, before trying to
make the user an admin. (Available at: `127.0.0.1:5000/signup`)

To make the user an admin, you will need to run the admin script in terminal by running the 
following command and follow the prompt:
```
python create_admin.py
```
